    "This project named Foodstore allows the user to add their food items with attributes (i.e. food quantity, expiration date, and category) to a dataframe. Once foods are entered into a dataframe, users can remove foods, edit food quantity, and check if a food is expired. Of course, all the dataframe methods can be used to further manipulate the food inventory data for experienced users. In the code comments, the dataframe in which food information is stored will be synonymous with the term inventory.\n",

    "I don't have any python background. I did take a few weeks of a C++ course in community college prior to transferrring to UCSD but dropped out because I could not understand at all what was being taught. Although we were taught an introduction on how to work with dataframes,\n",
    "the most difficult part for me was figuring out how to write code to loop through each category under a specific column and check if that category matched an input string. Then if it did, how to edit what was stored in the same row as the category. We did not learn how to do this in class and I used variations of this code I came up with for the last three functions of my project. I also used the datetime module and did some reading to understand the datetime objects. I did look into using input() and running a script so that the project would be more user-friendly. I also looked into having code to create a file storing the created dataframe inventory from the project on the local computer so that the user could close this project and open it again with their saved food inventory. Unfortunately, I did not implement either of these ideas due to time constraints. "
